# ModernDepictions

Sileo depictions for Cydia.

## TODO

- [x] Support for Packix and BigBoss depictions
  - **NOTE:** Although the support is implemented, the implementation is incomplete and since it's not possible to display ads from these repositories using Google's API, it's currently not available to everyone.
- [ ] ModernPackagenController for web depictions
- [ ] Make the package controller as functional as CYPackageController
- [ ] Wishlist/WishDia support
- [ ] tweakCompatible support

## Might be implemented in distant future

- Payment API support

## Warning

- This is the second time I used UIKit to create a user interface, and the first time I created a user interface without interface builder. I might be doing some things completely wrong. If you think I am, please send me DM on Twitter or open a new issue.
